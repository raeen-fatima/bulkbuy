## üõí BulkBuy ‚Äì Smarter Group Shopping Platform

BulkBuy is a collaborative shopping platform that lets users order essential items like groceries or household goods **either individually or as part of a group** to unlock better discounts. The more users join a group, the more everyone saves ‚Äî simple, social, and cost-effective!

---

### üöÄ What We've Built So Far

* ‚úÖ **Landing Page** with smooth UI & brand identity (BulkBuy logo, navigation, services).
* ‚úÖ **Login / Signup Authentication** using **Firebase Auth** with proper validation and form polish.
* ‚úÖ **Deals Listing Page** showing active bulk deals with:

  * Countdown timers
  * Group join status (e.g. `10/15 joined`)
  * Price comparison (individual vs. group)
* ‚úÖ **Deal Details Page** that:

  * Redirects unauthenticated users to Login
  * Lets logged-in users choose between **Group Order** and **Individual Order**
* ‚úÖ **Group Order Flow** with:

  * Live countdown
  * Joined members listing
  * Real-time chat box simulation
  * Group summary section (users, quantity, delivery address)
* ‚úÖ **Group Payment Section (UI stage)** to simulate collective billing based on individual quantities.

---

### üîê Authentication

* Firebase Auth is integrated.
* Signup and Login pages support real-time errors and success flow.
* Authenticated sessions are used to guard access to group/individual order pages.

---

### üì¶ Group Order Logic

* Users can see how many members have already joined a deal.
* Option to **Join Group Order** triggers a summary + countdown for deal expiry.
* Group orders maintain per-user quantity, address, and cost logic.
* Total group quantity is calculated and shown in real-time.

> You open BulkBuy ‚Üí See a good deal ‚Üí Want to save? ‚Üí Join a group instead of buying alone.

> When the group limit fills or the timer ends ‚Äî we place a bulk order and everyone saves. üí∞
